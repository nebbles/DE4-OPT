# Subsystem 2: Arrangement and traffic control of automated lift system

Author: Ben Greenberg

## Dependencies

This subsystem runs using ``Python 3``.

The packages used by this subsystem are listed in the repository ``requirements.txt``. Please refer there to manually install required packages.

Alternatively you can run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` at the top-level directory, to install all dependencies.

## Getting Started

This subsystem runs and displays its results in a Jupyter notebook. The main file for this is ``subsystem2.ipynb``. It imports supplementary code from the same directory, this is to keep the Jupyter notebook more streamlined and focused on outputting results.

To run this notebook, first ensure you have the required packages and Jupyter installed. Then run the command ``jupyter notebook`` in the desired directory, and then open the ``subsystem2.ipynb`` notebook.

## Performance

This subsystems code was developed on a Macintosh running macOS 10.14.1 with the following specifications:

| Processor Name:	      Intel Core i7
| Processor Speed:	      2.6 GHz
| Number of Processors:	  1
| Total Number of Cores:  4

Execution time is noted at the **end of the Jupyter notebook**. Last run time was approximately 4 seconds.
